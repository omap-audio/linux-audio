Some socs have a crossbar ip which muxes the dma requests
from the peripherals to the dma request input lines of the
appropriate dma controller. With this the dma controller's
available request lines are shared between the peripherals

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "ti,dma-crossbar"
- reg: Base address and the size of the crossbar registers.
- ti,dma-reqs: Total number of dma request lines available at dma controller.
- ti,reg-size: Size of a individual register in bytes. Every individual
	    register is assumed to be of same size. Valid sizes are 1, 2, 4.
- ti,dmas-reserved: List of the reserved dma lines that are not muxed using
		 crossbar. These dma lines are reserved in the soc,
		 so crossbar bar driver should not consider them as free
		 lines. This is a table of dma request-number and a count of
		 reserved values from that number.

Examples:
		crossbar_dma: crossbar@4a020000 {
			compatible = "ti,dma-crossbar";
			reg = <0x4a002b78 0x100>;
			ti,dma-reqs = <160>;
			ti,reg-size = <2>;
			ti,dmas-reserved = < 2, 5,
					     10, 2 >;
		};
