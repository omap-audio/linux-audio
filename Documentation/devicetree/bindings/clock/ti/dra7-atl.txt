Device Tree Clock bindings for ATL (Audio Tracking Logic) of DRA7 SoC.

This binding uses the common clock binding[1].
The ATL IP is used to generate clock to be used to synchronize baseband and
audio codec.
ATL can maintain a clock averages to some desired frequency based on the bws/aws
signals - can compensate the drift between the two ws signal.

[1] Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

Required properties:
- compatible : shall be "ti,dra7-atl-clock"
- #clock-cells : from common clock binding; shall be set to 1.
- clocks : link phandles to functional clock of ATL
- clock-names : Shall be set to "fck"
- reg : base address for the ATL IP
- ti,hwmods : Shall be set to "atl"

Optional properties:
- fck_parent : Should contain a valid clock name which will be used as parent
	       for the ATL fck
Configuration of ATL instances:
- atl{0/1/2/3} {
	- bws : Baseband word select signal selection
	- aws : Audio word select signal selection
};

For valid word select signals, see the dt-bindings/clk/ti-dra7-atl.h include
file.

Examples:
atl_clkin: atl@0x4843c000 {
	compatible = "ti,dra7-atl-clock";
	reg = <0x4843c000 0x3ff>;
	ti,hwmods = "atl";
	#clock-cells = <1>;
	clocks = <&atl_gfclk_mux>;
	clock-names = "fck";
	status = "disabled";
};

#include <dt-bindings/clk/ti-dra7-atl.h>

&atl_clkin {
	fck_parent = "dpll_abe_m2_ck";
	status = "okay";

	atl2 {
		bws = <DRA7_ATL_WS_MCASP2_FSX>;
		aws = <DRA7_ATL_WS_MCASP3_FSX>;
	};
};
