LED connected to PWM

Required properties:
- compatible : should be "pwm-leds".
- pwms : PWM property, please refer to: 
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pwm/pwm.txt
- pwm-names : (optional) Name to be used by the PWM subsystem for the PWM device
- label : (optional) The label for this LED.  If omitted, the label is
  taken from the node name (excluding the unit address).
- max-brightness : Maximum brightness possible for the LED
- linux,default-trigger :  (optional) This parameter, if present, is a
  string defining the trigger assigned to the LED.  Current triggers are:
    "backlight" - LED will act as a back-light, controlled by the framebuffer
		  system
    "default-on" - LED will turn on, but see "default-state" below
    "heartbeat" - LED "double" flashes at a load average based rate
    "ide-disk" - LED indicates disk activity
    "timer" - LED flashes at a fixed, configurable rate

Example:

twl_pwm: pwm {
	compatible = "ti,twl6030-pwm";
	#pwm-cells = <2>;
};

pwmled_keypad {
	compatible = "pwm-leds";
	pwms = <&twl_pwm 0 7812500>;
	pwm-names = "Keypad LED";

	label = "omap4::keypad";
	max-brightness = <127>;
};
